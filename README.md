# Personal Custom Portfolio

This project was started as a way to both showcase my best work as well as to provide myself with a place to test my abilities and put all my knowledge of web development to the test. The page has a section detailing information about myself, a section to display my work, and lastly a section with my social information such as my Github profile and my email.

## Details

Currently this page is written with just HTML and CSS but there are plans to add functionality and styling with JS in the near future.
A [normalization CSS file](https://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/) is loaded to ensure parity across web browsers before personal styling is loaded.
