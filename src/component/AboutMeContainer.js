        <img src="res/image/self_photo.jpg" alt="Myself, (William C.)" />
        My name is William. I'm a passionate software developer with nearly 10
        years of experience developing software in Java for a variety of
        situations ranging from server applications to game development. I've
        used various libraries to connect with different platforms and APIs such
        as Discord, Twitter, Twitch, and OpenGL. My biggest strength is my
        ability and motivation to learn, even on my own. Game development has
        always been my biggest hobby and career goal so I took that aspiration
        and used it as fuel to teach myself the inner workings of LWJGL 3 and
        its associated libraries. In just a couple of weeks I was able to
        develop my own 3D game engine with real time lighting and shadows which
        utilized common efficiency techniques such as instancing, batch sorting,
        and deferred shading completely from scratch. Im always excited to add
        new technologies to my toolbelt and I'll jump and any and every chance I
        get to do so.
